* Ved

Ved is a command line tool that helps you get the output you want using vim motions.

** Getting started

To use the tool you have to install a [[https://odin-lang.org/][odin]] compiler to compile the program.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/ProgKea/ved
  $ odin build .
#+END_SRC

Then you can use the program to edit a stream similar to [[https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/][sed]].

You can edit a file:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  $ ./<program> <command> <filepath>
#+END_SRC

Or edit stdin:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  $ echo -e 'Hello, World\nThis is a test' | ./<program> <command>
#+END_SRC

** Example

Example getting content inside brackets:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  $ echo -e 'Hello, (this is important content)\n(This is also important content)' | ./<program> 'f(lvt)'
#+END_SRC
This will output everything inside the brackets.

In vim you would do =vi(= this functionality is going to be implemented in the future.
